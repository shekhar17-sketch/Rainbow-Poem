awww ponies little ponies,
P is for pony F is for friends, but M is for magic where fun never ends.

why is this pony wearing a dress, why is she singing that friendship is best?

Just watch them dance and sing and fly, some ponies have wings and some are quite shy.

why I once saw a pony so colorful and cool, she beat up a dragon with hind hoofs and a stool.

but in all of Equestria there stands one above the rest, her name is Twilight Sparkle and she's simply the best.
